Tolstoy is best known for his two longest works, War and Peace (1865â69) and Anna Karenina (1875â77), which are commonly regarded as among the finest novels ever written. War and Peace in particular seems virtually to define this form for many readers and critics. Among Tolstoys shorter works, The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886) is usually classed among the best examples of the novella. Especially during his last three decades Tolstoy also achieved world renown as a moral and religious teacher. His doctrine of nonresistance to evil had an important influence on Gandhi. Although Tolstoys religious ideas no longer command the respect they once did, interest in his life and personality has, if anything, increased over the years.
